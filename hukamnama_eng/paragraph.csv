This body is frail; old age is overtaking it. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved, while others die, to be reincarnated; they continue coming and going. Others die, to be reincarnated; they continue coming and going, and in the end, they depart with regret. Without the Name, there is no peace. According to one’s actions here, so are the rewards received; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. In the City of Death, there is pitch darkness and huge clouds of dust; neither sister nor brother is there. This body is frail; old age is overtaking it.  || 1 ||   The body becomes golden, when one unites with the True Guru. Doubt and Maya have been removed from within me, and I am merged in the True Name. Merged in the True Name, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; meeting my Beloved, I have found peace. I am in constant bliss, day and night; egotism has been dispelled from within me. I fall at the feet of those persons who enshrine the Naam within their consciousness. The body becomes golden, when one unites with the True Guru.  || 2 ||   We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru imparts understanding. Without the True Guru, they are deluded by doubt; going to the world hereafter, what face will they show? What face will they show, when they go there? They will regret and repent for their sins — their actions will bring them only pain and suffering. Those who are imbued with the Naam are dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord’s Love; they merge into the Being of their Husband Lord. I cannot conceive of any other as great as the Lord; unto whom should I go and speak? We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru imparts understanding.  || 3 ||   I fall at the feet of those who praise the Truest of the True. Those humble beings are true and immaculately pure; meeting them, all filth is washed off. Meeting them, all filth is washed off; bathing in the Pool of Truth, one becomes truthful, with intuitive ease. The True Guru has given me the realization of the Naam, the Name of the immaculate, unfathomable, imperceptible Lord. Those who worship the Lord with devotion night and day are attuned to His Love; O Nanak, they are absorbed in the True Lord. I fall at the feet of those who meditate on the Truest of the True.  || 4 || 4 ||
